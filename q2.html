        <h1>How the Action attribute works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p> Within the form element, there are multiple attributes that will perform different tasks and format the data that is inputted into the form. The Action attribute tells the server what to do after the form has been submitted. The Action attribute can will send the submitted data to wherever you set it, and be processed within the server.</p>
